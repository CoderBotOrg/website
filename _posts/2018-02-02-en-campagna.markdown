On February 19, 2018, the crowdfunding campaign for the CoderBot, a robot for playing thinking, starts.

CoderBot is a robot designed for educational use in Primary and Secondary Schools. It was "adopted" by the University of Milano-Bicocca which, with this crowdfunding campaign, starts a development process to make the CoderBot even easier to program, robust and functional with respect to various educational objectives. With the contributions that we will receive through this crowdfunding campaign, we will improve the aspects related to programming and control software, in order to offer schools, teachers, children and parents the most suitable tool for learning and having fun at the same time.

The CoderBot is used as part of the research and training activities carried out by the RobotiCCS Lab, the Robotics Laboratory for Cognitive and Social Sciences of the Department of Human Sciences for Education "R. Massa” of the University of Milan-Bicocca.

The team that follows the project and will develop the new CoderBot is made up of Edoardo Datteri, Leonardo Mariani and Roberto Previtera.

Edoardo is a university researcher in philosophy of science and deals with the philosophy of Artificial Intelligence and cognitive sciences. Leonardo, associate professor, deals with software engineering and self-healing systems. Finally Roberto, project manager in the IT field, is an expert in artificial intelligence and robotics.

The team has specialized but at the same time different skills, so as to have the necessary know-how to develop a project that combines robotics, teaching and innovation.

«Our goal – say Edoardo, Leonardo and Roberto – is to create an educational robot that is easy to use and can be customized according to the age of the students and the teacher's educational objectives.
CoderBot will allow schools and teachers to improve learning in science, information technology and technology: children will in fact be able to program and use the robot by applying not only technical knowledge, but also abstract reasoning and the scientific method».

Among other things, the campaign is a great opportunity for schools and teachers: in fact, among the rewards provided for those who want to support the project, there are both the CoderBot itself and training workshops to learn how to use it and program it for class. Furthermore, among the rewards designed for schools there are fleets of 4 and 10 CoderBots that can be used for interactive teaching with large groups of students.


### The campaign will run from February 19 to April 26, 2018 and will take place on the DeRev platform.
### The goal is to raise 5,000 euros.

### From 19 February you can support the project with a donation by connecting to the address
