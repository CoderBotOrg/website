As usual CoderBot participated in the MeetMeTonight. Also in this 2017 edition there were several workshops open to the public.

### The MeetMeTonight 2017
The MeetMeTonight - Researchers' night event is organized by Italian universities with the aim of disseminating knowledge and involving people, non-experts, in the work of researchers.

### Activities with CoderBot
This year CoderBot was present at the stand of the Department of Human Sciences for Education “R. Massa”, University of Milan-Bicocca, with three permanent laboratories available to children and teenagers.

Of the three workshops planned this year, two were similar to those presented the previous year, namely "The Game of the Scientist" and "The Cat and the Mouse" while the third, "Tinkering" was oriented towards older children or teachers who wish to approach the CoderBot as a teaching tool.
