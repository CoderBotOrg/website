Less than a year after the crowdfunding campaign that allowed us to raise the funds necessary for the development and enhancement of our educational robot, the CoderBots requested as a reward by the project's supporters are being shipped.

First of all, we want to thank you all for believing in us, for generously supporting us even beyond the fundraising target, in fact the campaign ended with more than 7,000 euros compared to the 5,000 initially requested.

In particular, we thank Sorgenia for the contribution that made it possible to donate both the robots and the training to use them to the fullest to two schools. By the way, the training workshop for the teachers of the two schools took place on 11 and 12 January. If you want to know how it went, here's an article for you: [When robots take the chair. New educational scenarios](https://bnews.unimib.it/blog/quando-i-robot-salgono-cattedra-nuovi-scenari-educativi)

In recent months, young students from the Milano-Bicocca University, in particular from the Computer Science Department, have been working on the new version of the robot. There were many aspects to work on: the interface has been improved, so as to offer programming options that are simpler to use and at the same time more varied. At the same time, the chassis and the external structure were also modified, so as to make it more functional.

At this point, dear supporters, we just have to give you some operational indications: starting from February 7th, the CoderBots will be shipped to the addresses you have indicated. In the box together with the bot you will find a tutorial for its operation, assembly instructions (only for those who have requested to receive it disassembled) and a personalized thank you card.

For any assistance or information on robots you can write to us at: [support@coderbot.org](mailto:support@coderbot.org) or on the group: [CoderBot Users](https://groups.google.com/forum/ #!forum/codebot-users)

Have fun and learn with CoderBot!
