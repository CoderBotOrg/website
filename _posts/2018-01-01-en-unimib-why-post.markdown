Innovation, training, discovery and science. These are the main ingredients of
CorderBot, the educational robotics project on which the University of Milano-Bicocca
decided to bet. The Department of Human Sciences of Education and the Department of Computer Science, putting a their respective responsibilities.

In recent months, the University has signed an agreement to manage the development of
CoderBot and explore the possible uses of the robot.

The University of Milano-Bicocca has chosen to support this project because the
interactive teaching and robotics represents one of the main lines of research on which
the University is working: in particular the innovative teaching aimed at children and
Schools is considered of primary importance for the concrete impacts it has on the whole
society. In this sense, the project benefits from the continuous experimentation of new ones methodologies and technical solutions developed with the scientific rigor that
distinguishes the activity of the University's research laboratories.

The CoderBot campaign is the first that the University experiments with a view to
develop a stable crowdfunding activity available to its community:
students and ex-students, researchers, professors, research fellows and doctoral students.

CoderBot crowdfunding represents a first step to develop a new
way to fund research.
