CoderBot is an open source project, which means that all of its source code is available for use and extension, both the software and the hardware. 

To be able to develop the project, it is essential to have proper documentation. Until now, this documentation has been difficult to find, and many aspects of the project, such as the hardware and software architecture and the information needed to set up a development environment, have not been documented at all.

This information is now available on the Developer Documentation Website at https://dev.coderbot.org. 

The documentation is a "work in progress," as more detailed documentation still needs to be provided for each software component (such as the backend and frontend), but it is a good start to understand what CoderBot is and to begin working with it.

Have fun!
